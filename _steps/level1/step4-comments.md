Let's start with comments. Comments are notes that people can read and computers will ignore.

They will help us to guide you through the JavaScript introduction journey.

A comment can either be a single line comment, or a multi line comment block.

```javascript
// This is an Answer of a single line comment. 
// They are created by putting // at the start of the line.

/*
    Multi-line comments look like this. 
    When you are writing actual code, put it outside these 
    comment blocks, so the computer doesn't ignore them.
