We are going to be learning about JavaScript by using it in web pages.  This is the most common use of JavaScript.

We have already created a web page for you to use, and have left a `javascript` file blank for you to put your code in. You can find this file by opening this project in your Code Editor and navigating to the `muses-code-website` folder. In here you will find a Javascript file named `script.js`, a CSS (style) file named `style.css` and an HTML file named `index.html`.

So what actually is a web page?

It's just a text file with two different types of content in it.

1. text content, ie the actual words that will be displayed
2. HTML tags, which tell the browser how the content is supposed to be displayed.

## Let's get started!

For this workshop, you'll be editing code inside the `script.js` file using your code editor. To see the changes you've made, open up the `index.html` file in your Web Browser. You can do this by:
- **Mac:** opening Finder, navigating to the project folder and double clicking on `index.html`
- **Windows:** opening File Explorer, nativating to the project folder and double clicking on `index.html`
- **Either:** opening your Web Browser, clicking on the `File` menu, clicking `Open File`, navigating to the project folder and clicking on the `index.html` file

So before we get started, make sure you have:
- a web browser open with this website *and* your `index.html` page loaded
- a code editor with your `script.js` file open.

##### Tip: 
For every **Challenge** we give you, we will also show an **Answer** of what the completed code might look like. Try not to peek at this until you've attempted the code yourself. Also remember that there are many ways to code things, so your answer might look slightly different to ours.

Ready? Let's go!
